arduino source code can be found in the ../../RES/arduino/433MHz directory

it is assumed that you have the arduino package installed in the default location on a linux machine

you will need to edit the /dev/ttyACM0 line in the ../RES/arduino/433MHz/Makefile

compile and upload to your arduino:
make; sudo make upload
